Hi I'm green-gecko! 
I am a 17 year old high school student junior aiming to get a job in Web Development.
I'm extremely new to Git-Hub and Webdevelopment in General. 
I'm out here to post all of my projects, and encahance my Portfolio. 🗃️🗄️
I aim to build connections with others to get small jobs here and there, basically being a freelance Web Developer for some cash.  🙂👌💵
Also right now I'm only using HTML and CSS, right now I'm mainly using thoes for building websites. !

I will learn Java-Script but obviously that will take time
